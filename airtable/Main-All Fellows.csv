Debbie Brackeen is the executive vice president, and chief strategy & innovation officer for CSAA Insurance Group, which has offered automobile, homeowners and other personal lines of insurance to AAA members for more than 100 years. CSAA is one of the top property and casualty personal lines insurers in the United States.

Prior to joining CSAA IG, served as the global head of innovation at Citigroup.

Ms. Brackeen holds a bachelor’s degree from Stanford University. She has completed executive education programs at the Northwestern Kellogg School of Management, INSEAD, and Stanford Law School.","After completing my first year of pre-med as a Stanford undergrad, I realized medicine wasn't for me! I subsequently purchased my first Macintosh computer and became so obsessed with it that it landed me a contract job with Apple doing user testing of third-party software programs. This ultimately led to 10 years at Apple and launched my career at numerous tech companies in Silicon Valley. 
 
I’ve always gravitated toward ‘the next new thing.’ I love that tech is constantly evolving, and frequently disruptive with the ability to change the economics of different business models. While at HP, I realized it was possible for me to focus my career on corporate innovation and venture. I am fortunate to have been able to do that for the past 15+ years, initially at HP, then at Citibank, and now at CSAA.

Lisa Shalett,,,Mentor,Lisa,Shalett,lisa.shalett@gmail.com,NY,United States,Co-Founder,Extraordinary Women on Boards,,,linkedin.com/in/lisashalett,,,,,,,,,"Lisa Shalett is an accomplished senior executive, advisor and independent board director, with a remarkable breadth of leadership and operational experience over her 25+ year career, including 13 years as a Goldman Sachs Partner. She is the Co- Founder of Extraordinary Women on Boards, a dynamic peer-to-peer community of hundreds of women corporate board directors focused on advancing board excellence, and raising the presence and influence of women on boards. Having served on boards of every type (public, PE-backed, VC-backed, family-owned, and non-profit), Lisa brings a deep understanding of stakeholder priorities and long-term value creation.

Lisa has held global leadership roles ranging from International Equities Sales & Trading, to Compliance, Legal and Audit, to Brand Marketing, Digital Transformation, and Strategic Innovation. Her expertise spans global risk and crisis management, capital markets, marketing, digital transformation, talent development, and governance. She managed Goldman Sachs’ brand through the financial crisis. 

Lisa currently serves on the boards of PennyMac Financial (NYSE: PFSI), AccuWeather, and MPower Partners, Japan’s first female-founded and first ESG-focused VC firm, and chairs the board of non-profit Generation W. She is a Distinguished Fellow at the Coach K/Fuqua Center on Leadership and Ethics at Duke University, a Senior Fellow for the McDonald Conference on Leaders of Character at West Point, and supports high-impact entrepreneurs through Endeavor.org. She is a frequent speaker, panelist, and podcaster and a sought-after mentor and coach. ","Lisa Shalett is a perpetual student who is constantly curious, and seeks out diverse perspectives and new ideas. She loves to connect people and connect dots, and often sees similarities across seemingly disparate things. She is a committed mentor and beneficiary of (a lot of) reverse mentorship, and embraces and advocates for diversity.

In terms of formal education, Lisa earned her MBA from Harvard Business School, and BA, summa cum laude, in East Asian Studies (Japan) from Harvard University -- Lisa's Japan interest came from a student exchange experience she was lucky to have with a Japanese family in Tokyo while she was in high school, that ended up shaping her early career and understanding of empathy.
 
Lisa currently lives in Westchester, NY and NYC, and has two sons, ages 22 and 24. ",,,,,Joon Sung Park,Class 27,https://form.fillout.com/t/tGQsggHjcLus?id=recPu6GARqHEQOJFn

Prior to that, Rodrigo was Managing Director of Endeavor Brazil. Hailed by Thomas Friedman as 'the best anti-poverty program of all,' Endeavor is a nonprofit that pioneered the field of 'High-Impact Entrepreneurship.' Rodrigo began his career at Endeavor in 2003, coordinating a high-tech business development program in partnership with FAPESP, the biggest research foundation in Brazil, providing support to 100 high-tech entrepreneurs that collectively raised several million dollars in seed-stage capital. By 2005, he was managing a portfolio of 12 high-growth companies with combined annual revenues of near $500M. In 2007, he created Entrepreneurship Week Brazil, mobilizing more than 1.5 million participants in the country and connecting the Brazilian entrepreneurial ecosystem for the first time in history. 

Rodrigo left Endeavor in 2008 to pursue an opportunity to participate in a turnaround of Mãe Terra, a high-growth company and leader in the healthy foods segment in Brazil. In less than one year, he developed a new branding strategy and created more than 20 new products that were launched successfully in the market. After making strides in this role, he was invited by the board of directors of Endeavor to rejoin the organization in 2009. 

As Managing Director of Endeavor, Rodrigo created new business units such as Education, Public Policies and Digital Outreach, expanded to new regions in Brazil, and started shifting Endeavor from a traditional NGO to a social business with recurrent revenues. In less than 4 years, Endeavor had a 4x increase in annual revenues and cash reserves, formalizing the creation of its endowment fund. 

Earlier, Rodrigo created an educational program distributed to 40 top universities in Brazil, impacting more than 100 entrepreneurship professors and 2,500 students.

To date, over 70% of the companies we have supported have closed subsequent rounds of financing from firms like Sequoia, Blue Yard, First Round, and Ribbit Capital.

We represent a pairing of classic pre-seed underwriting with late stage diligence and support functions.  We think this approach will become an industry norm due to its effectiveness.

Her mission is to back ambitious, thoughtful and diverse founders to transform healthcare from scarcity of clinicians and appointments to ease of access through technology and to enable new and better treatments to reach patients.

QUOTE: “My daughter was diagnosed with a rare condition which meant that I had to navigate several health systems and I found it really difficult to get to a diagnosis. But I also saw that there was a lot of promise in terms of both how healthcare could be delivered, if better digital tools were used, and how technology could help to get to better therapies.”

Julia’s centre of gravity is London with the Francis Crick Institute on Phoenix Court’s doorstep and DeepMind, UCLH and Royal Free Hospital nearby. She’s Swedish and is excited about fantastic Nordic founders with global ambitions, and is seeing phenomenal healthcare talent in Israel and Boston.

QUOTE: “I really like founders that can help me understand their unique perspective – whether it be life experiences, or previous companies that they&#039;ve built or been associated with – that have led them to the insights that they have. I also look for founders where I can understand and see their ability to attract talent and build teams.

As Founder and Managing Partner of Endurance28, Consuelo has brought a fresh perspective to venture capital, investing in overlooked opportunities that translate into outsized returns, while proving that a Latina without a sheepskin from Stanford can succeed in Silicon Valley while promoting endeavors that benefit people and the planet.
Raised in Mexico, Consuelo excelled at academics, completing high school at 16. After graduating from the University of Miami with a degree in electrical engineering, she returned to Mexico to find a job. But in the late 1980s, no one was interested in hiring a female electrical engineer — much less one who just turned 21.
Resisting entreaties to go into something more “gender-appropriate” like sales, she started a successful PC manufacturing business. Her next venture, an IT training center, proved so popular that a new floor of classrooms had to be added every year. Not bad for a woman who was the first one in her family to attend college. 
Encountering both sexism and corruption in her field, Consuelo decided to change the system, attending civil resistance meetings and helping on a friend’s underdog campaign for mayor of Cuernavaca. He won, and invited her to manage information systems for the city. Consuelo never liked politics, but saw this as an opportunity to promote change in Mexico and improve social justice 
The Mexican government’s sudden devaluation of the peso in 1994 precipitated a financial crisis, sending interest rates spiraling and forcing Consuelo to sell her IT training center. But when the mayor she worked for was elected governor in the largest science hub outside of Mexico City, she spearheaded the creation of the Office of Innovation, Science &amp; Technology, establishing a tech transfer fund, a science museum, innovation center, magazine, podcasts and TV programs.
Encouraged to become a venture capitalist, Consuelo moved to San Francisco in 2006 to work for a startup, then ventured out on her own to begin a software development company. With the launch of SVLC (now Endurance28), she became the first Mexican woman to found an early-stage venture capital firm in either Mexico or Silicon Valley. Her first angel investment, Clip, became a unicorn and the cornerstone of her first fund. By the time she launched her second fund, she had a proven track record and was able to attract investors inside the U.S.
Before becoming a US citizen, she was granted an 0-1 Visa for &quot;Aliens with Exceptional Abilities.&quot; Recognized as one of the 100 most influential Latinas in the nation and as a “Distinguished Engineer” by IEEE Mexico, Consuelo holds two master’s degrees in science, completed a year of graduate studies in genomics, is a Kauffman Fellow, and Endurance28 has performed in the top 5 percent since its founding.","Consuelo is an avid ultra-marathon runner, has completed multiple Ironmans and ultra-marathons, and has cycled several times from south Mexico City to Acapulco (300 km) across the sierras in less than a day. She has also crossed Ireland running, raising funds for a nonprofit in Kenya that educates and empowers girls from poverty to become community leaders.",https://www.kauffmanfellows.org/fellows/consuelo-valverde,https://wa.me/14156940507,"Kauffman Fellows Community,KF | Bay Area,KF | Central - US,KF | LATAM,KF | Mexico,KF | NYC,KF SIG | AI,KF SIG | Climate & Sustainability,KF SIG | Deep Tech,KF SIG | Emerging Managers,KF SIG | Healthcare,KF SIG | Impact,KF SIG | Women's Group,London Summit 2025,Sao Paulo Trek 2025","Pre-Seed,Seed",Carlos Murguia,Class 30,https://form.fillout.com/t/tGQsggHjcLus?id=rec54X529f1RTfdoj

She is particularly interested in entrepreneurs building breakthrough companies enabling human and environmental health, access, and productivity.

Deena believes humanity-focused venture investing is about more than just capital, approaching company building with support and empathy for founders and a lens towards the ethical and societal implications of technologies. Since joining us in late 2019, she has led Lux's investment in Mos, a technology platform seeking to make college more affordable; Shiru, a company that leverages computational design to create enhanced proteins to help feed the world sustainably, where she is also a board director; and Neo, which simplifies SMB accounting to unlock scientific innovation.

Prior to joining Lux, Deena was a Partner at GV (formerly Google Ventures). She previously led strategic partnerships for early stage products in healthcare, research, machine intelligence and search at Google and also directed social impact investments at Google.org.

Before she became an investor, Deena had diverse people-centric global experiences as an aspiring anthropologist, journalist, diplomat, aid worker and technologist. She was a Presidential Management Fellow at the U.S. Department of State under Secretary Clinton, where she helped launch President Obama's first Global Entrepreneurship Summit in 2010. Her non-traditional path to venture capital landed her in roles that brought people together to foster partnerships through diplomacy, public service, and technology. It has also cultivated Deena's deep conviction in the power of founders of new ventures to positively transform the future and an unparalleled network to help them achieve it.

Deena serves on the Boards of several non-profits including Tarjimly, TechWadi, Technovation and AMIDEAST. She is a Kauffman Fellow, a Council on Foreign Relations Term Member, and a Forbes Contributor. Deena was a founding VC member of the Valence Fund Network for black entrepreneurs.

At Sella, Jeremy leads the firm’s global venture capital fund investment strategy and serves on its seven-member Investment Committee, architecting and overseeing the platform end-to-end—from thesis and portfolio design to diligence, portfolio construction, and GP/LP engagement across the U.S. and Europe.

Sella’s portfolio spans approximately 50 venture funds globally, ranging from early stage emerging managers to established growth-stage firms, with a focus on themes such as fintech and the future of financial services, AI and automation, impact and sustainability, and digital assets/Web3. SDV also invests in generalist managers who shape the broader innovation economy through company building and sector transformation.

Jeremy also founded and chairs the Sella Group’s Global Advisory Network (GAN), a cross-sector brain trust of global leaders in AI, fintech, corporate venture capital, impact, and deep-tech infrastructure. The GAN provides Sella and its partners with an additional layer of strategic insight and network leverage—bridging fund and direct investments and fostering collaboration among founders, investors, and corporate innovators.

Drawing on his operator’s background and deep relationships across LP, GP, and corporate ecosystems, Jeremy acts as connective tissue between capital and the innovation economy—translating networks into value for venture portfolios and extending that impact into private equity and strategic corporate platforms.

He combines a multidisciplinary background in investing, law, banking, and impact, which has shaped his approach to building scalable, values-aligned investment platforms. Before joining Sella, Jeremy led the Early Stage Practice Group at Silicon Valley Bank, where he worked with hundreds of founders and venture firms across the innovation ecosystem. He later served as Chief Revenue Officer and Global Head of Early Stage at the first nationally chartered digital bank in the U.S. Earlier in his career, he founded and built the Emerging Companies/Venture Practice at a national law firm, advising founders and investors at the intersection of law, capital, and technology.

Jeremy is a Kauffman Fellow (Class 23), recipient of the Class Leadership Award, and serves as Co-Chair of the Kauffman Fellows LP SIG, which convenes global limited partners to share insights and shape best practices.

Reflecting his belief that success and impact are inseparable, he has spent his career advancing mission-driven organizations through board and leadership roles with the Techstars Foundation (founding member, empowering underrepresented entrepreneurs globally through innovation), Active Minds (combating mental-health stigma among young adults), the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society (NY Chapter, past President), and the Friends of the IDF (past President).

Outside of work, Jeremy lives in Westchester, New York, with his wife and four children. A serial hobbyist and lifelong learner, he cycles through interests including magic, music, autobiographical memory, guitar, and endurance sports. He aims to read a book each week, drawing inspiration from non-fiction, recent conversations, and others’ favorite recommendations. A crossword enthusiast, he is currently on a streak of more than 1,675 consecutive completed New York Times puzzles (as of Q4 2025). A lifelong Springsteen fan, he finds energy in storytelling, music, and creativity. He has coached youth sports for a decade and loves spending time outdoors with his family as often as possible.

This approach has already driven investments in Aerospace (HTS-enabled super magnets for space), value-based Health Tech, and Hard Tech (plasma-driven metal casting).

Under her leadership, Altos has built a diverse portfolio of over 80 companies in Korea and Asia, investing in 8 to 10 new startups annually, with cumulative investment volume surpassing $1 billion. For the past seven years, founders have consistently ranked Altos as their most preferred investor.

Heeeun’s deep appreciation for technology and entrepreneurship, combined with her unique perspective as a former founder, allows her to build strong, trust-based relationships with founders.
